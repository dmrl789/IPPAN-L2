# IPPAN-L2

**IPPAN-L2** hosts the Layer 2 (L2) execution and asset hubs that sit on top of the IPPAN CORE (L1) deterministic settlement layer.

IPPAN-L2 focuses on:
- Tokenisation of real-world assets (RWA)
- NFTs and digital rights
- AI and dataset licensing
- IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) payments
- Cross-chain bridges and interoperability
- General-purpose applications and marketplaces

All application and asset logic lives in L2 “Hubs”, while IPPAN CORE remains a pure, ultra-fast, deterministic settlement engine.

## L2 Hubs

Planned IPPAN Hubs:

- **IPPAN FIN** – L2 Finance Hub for RWA, bonds, funds, institutional stablecoins.
- **IPPAN DATA** – L2 Data + AI Hub for datasets, models, InfoLAW content, identity state.
- **IPPAN M2M** – L2 Machine-to-Machine Hub for IoT, agents, microtransactions.
- **IPPAN WORLD** – L2 Applications Hub for marketplaces, NFTs, consumer + enterprise apps.
- **IPPAN BRIDGE** – L2 Interoperability Hub for cross-chain asset flows and onboarding.

## Status

Early design and scaffolding phase:
- L2 core types (batches, proofs, hub IDs)
- Architecture docs (L1/L2 separation and Hub roles)
- Per-Hub specs and examples to follow

This repo does **not** contain IPPAN CORE code. CORE lives in the main IPPAN repository.
