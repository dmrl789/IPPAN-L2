# IPPAN-L2 Whitepaper Notes (Repository-local)

This repository does not currently ship a full whitepaper. This file captures **whitepaper-ready** text blocks
that align with the implementation and operational guarantees in this repo.

> IPPAN-L2 supports deterministic operational snapshots for disaster recovery and migration. Snapshots preserve all verifiable execution state while excluding secrets and consensus-critical data, allowing full recovery without affecting Layer-1 ordering or finality.
